===========
This repository is some open source code I'm reading in my spare time, and I have added some test codes to learn the structures of these projects.

## [cmus](https://github.com/liuluheng/cmus)
`cmus` is a music player written in C. I'm interesting about how the music wave came out, so I got this read. 
`cmus` 's code is really good-writting, and it uses [Linux kernel coding style](http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle), 
    I think it could be the **model** of how C code should be written.


** [scmus](https://github.com/liuluheng/codereading/tree/master/learn-cmus/scmus)    
`learn-cmus/scmus` is a small music player I extract from cmus. It's all about how music came out. It was implemented as playing only one song over and over. If you curious about how music is played, you can have a look.:smile:

## lemon
`lemon` is a LALR(1) grammar parser generator, only about 5000 lines code, and it has been applied to the real production.
I think it's worth reading for who want to know LALR(1). Athough its code style is not so tasty, actually it's not that hard..:smile:
