#codereading
===========
This repository is some open source code I'm reading in my spare time, and I have added some test codes to learn the structures of these projects.

##cmus
`cmus` is a music player written in C. I'm interesting about how the music wave came out, so I got this read. 
`cmus` 's code is really good-writting, and it observes the Linux Kernel coding standard, 
    I think it could be the **model** of how C code should be written.

##lemon
`lemon` is a LALR(1) grammar parser generator, only about 5000 lines code, and it has been applied to the real production.
I think it's worth reading for who want to know LALR(1). Athough its code style is not so tasty, actually it's not that hard..:smile:
